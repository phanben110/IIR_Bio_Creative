BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc500|t|Glutathione-Hemin/Hematin Adduct Formation to Disintegrate Cytotoxic Oxidant Hemin/Hematin in Human K562 Cells and Red Blood Cells' Hemolysates: Impact of Glutathione on the Hemolytic Disorders and Homeostasis.
BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc500|a|Hemin, an oxidized form of heme, acts as potent oxidant to regulate glutathione (GSH) content in pro-erythroid K562 nucleated cells, via activation of the KEAP1/NRF2 defensive signaling pathway. Moreover, GSH, as an essential metabolite, is involved in the regulation of cell-redox homeostasis and proposed to scavenge cytotoxic free heme, which is released from hemoglobin of damaged red blood cells (RBCs) during different hemolytic disorders. In the present study, we aimed to uncover the molecular mechanism by which GSH inhibits hemin-induced cytotoxicity (HIC) by affecting hemin's structural integrity in K562 cells and in RBC hemolysates. GSH, along with other thiols (cysteine, thioglycolic acid, and mercaptoethanol) altered the spectrum of hemin, while each of them co-added with hemin in cultures of K562 cells prevented HIC and growth arrest and markedly reduced the intracellular level of hemin. In addition, GSH endogenous levels served as a barrier to HIC in K562 cells, as shown by the depletion in GSH. LC-MS/MS analysis of the in vitro reaction between hemin and GSH revealed at least five different isomers of GSH-hemin adducts, as well as hydroxy derivatives as reaction products, which are characterized by unique mass spectra (MS). The latter allowed the detection of adducts in human RBC hemolysates. Based on these findings, we proposed a molecular mechanism via which GSH prevents HIC and structurally disintegrates heme. An analogous reaction was observed in RBC hemolysates via direct inter-reaction between hematin (ferric and hydroxide heme) released from hemoglobin and GSH. Overall, GSH-hematin adducts could be considered as novel entities of the human metabolome of RBCs in hemolytic disorders.

BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc501|t|The amplification of CNS damage in Alzheimer's disease due to SARS-CoV2 infection.
BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc501|a|Pre-existing Alzheimer's disease is a risk factor for severe/fatal COVID-19 and infection by SARS-CoV2 virus has been associated with an increased incidence of un-masked Alzheimer's disease. The molecular basis whereby SARS-CoV2 may amplify Alzheimer's disease is not well understood. This study analyzed the molecular changes in autopsy brain tissues from people with pre-existing dementia who died of COVID-19 (n = 5) which was compared to equivalent tissues of people who died of COVID-19 with no history of dementia (n = 8), Alzheimer's disease pre-COVID-19 (n = 10) and aged matched controls (n = 10) in a blinded fashion. Immunohistochemistry analyses for hyperphosphorylated tau protein, alpha-synuclein, and beta-amyloid-42 confirmed the diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (n = 4), and Lewy body dementia (n = 1) in the COVID-19 group. The brain tissues from patients who died of COVID-19 with no history of dementia showed a diffuse microangiopathy marked by endocytosis of spike subunit S1 and S2 in primarily CD31+ endothelia with strong co-localization with ACE2, Caspase-3, IL6, TNFalpha, and Complement component 6 that was not associated with SARS-CoV2 RNA. Microglial activation marked by increased TMEM119 and MCP1 protein expression closely paralleled the endocytosed spike protein. The COVID-19 tissues from people with no pre-existing dementia showed, compared to controls, 5-10x fold increases in expression of neuronal NOS and NMDAR2 as well as a marked decrease in the expression of proteins whose loss is associated with worsening Alzheimer's disease: MFSD2a, SHIP1, BCL6, BCL10, and BACH1. In COVID-19 tissues from people with dementia the widespread spike-induced microencephalitis with the concomitant microglial activation co-existed in the same areas where neurons had hyperphosphorylated tau protein suggesting that the already dysfunctional neurons were additionally stressed by the SARS-CoV2 induced microangiopathy. ACE2+ human brain endothelial cells treated with high dose (but not vaccine equivalent low dose) spike S1 protein demonstrated each of the molecular changes noted in the in vivo COVID-19 and COVID-19/Alzheimer's disease brain tissues. It is concluded that fatal COVID-19 induces a diffuse microencephalitis and microglial activation in the brain due to endocytosis of circulating viral spike protein that amplifies pre-existing dementia in at least two ways: 1) modulates the expression of proteins that may worsen Alzheimer's disease and 2) stresses the already dysfunctional neurons by causing an acute proinflammatory/hypercoagulable/hypoxic microenvironment in areas with abundant hyperphosphorylated tau protein and/or betaA-42.

BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc502|t|Case report: Rhabdomyolysis and kidney injury in a statin-treated hypothyroid patient-kill two birds with one stone.
BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc502|a|Statin treatment for hypercholesterolemia may cause reversible rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury in susceptible patients. However, persistent rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury following discontinuation of statins require careful evaluation of the underlying causes to avoid missing a curable disease. We describe a 50-year-old woman with hypercholesterolemia [total cholesterol 345 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 266 mg/dL] on atorvastatin therapy (40 mg daily) for 1 month that presented with myalgia and muscle weakness. Relevant laboratory studies revealed persistent higher hypercholesterolemia with total cholesterol (312 mg/dL), high creatine kinase (CK) (5,178 U/L), and high creatinine levels (1.5 mg/dL) without dysmorphic red blood cells and proteinuria. Despite the cessation of statin therapy, serum CK level increased to 9,594 U/L, and creatinine remained at 1.5 mg/dL. A thorough work-up to assess potential underlying causes indicated low T3 and free T4 and high thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, consistent with hypothyroidism. With aggressive thyroxine replacement for 1 month, all of the clinical features, along with elevated serum CK and creatinine levels, were completely resolved. This case highlights the fact that hypothyroidism must be kept in mind as a potential cause of concomitant myopathy and kidney injury, especially in patients with statin-resistant hypercholesterolemia.

BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc503|t|Response of Cd, Zn Translocation and Distribution to Organic Acids Heterogeneity in Brassica juncea L.
BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc503|a|In order to investigate the translocation, distribution, and organic acid heterogeneity characteristics in Brassica juncea L., a pot experiment with the exogenous application of Cd and Zn was conducted to analyze the effects of Cd, Zn, and organic acid contents and heterogeneity on the translocation and distribution of Cd and Zn. The results showed that the Cd and Zn contents of B. juncea were mainly accumulated in the roots. The Cd content in the symplast sap was 127.66-146.50% higher than that in the apoplast sap, while the opposite was true for Zn. The distribution of Cd in xylem sap occupied 64.60% under 20 mg kg-1 Cd treatment, and Zn in xylem sap occupied 60.14% under 100 mg kg-1 Zn treatment. The Cd was predominantly distributed in the vacuole, but the Zn was predominantly distributed in the cell walls. In addition, oxalic and malic acids were present in high concentrations in B. juncea. In the vacuole, correlation analysis showed that the contents of Cd were negatively correlated with the contents of oxalic acid and succinic acid, and the contents of Zn were positively correlated with the contents of malic acid and acetic acid. The contents of Cd and Zn were negatively related to the contents of oxalic acid and citric acid in xylem sap. Therefore, Cd in B. juncea was mainly absorbed through the symplast pathway, and Zn was mainly absorbed through the apoplast pathway, and then Cd and Zn were distributed in the vacuole and cell walls. The Cd and Zn in B. juncea are transferred upward through the xylem and promoted by oxalic acid, malic acid, and citric acid.

BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc504|t|Down-regulation of A20 promotes immune escape of lung adenocarcinomas.
BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc504|a|Inflammation is a well-known driver of lung tumorigenesis. One strategy by which tumor cells escape tight homeostatic control is by decreasing the expression of the potent anti-inflammatory protein tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), also known as A20. We observed that tumor cell intrinsic loss of A20 markedly enhanced lung tumorigenesis and was associated with reduced CD8+ T cell-mediated immune surveillance in patients with lung cancer and in mouse models. In mice, we observed that this effect was completely dependent on increased cellular sensitivity to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) signaling by aberrant activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and increased downstream expression and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). Interrupting this autocrine feed forward loop by knocking out IFN-alpha/beta receptor completely restored infiltration of cytotoxic T cells and rescued loss of A20 depending tumorigenesis. Downstream of STAT1, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was highly expressed in A20 knockout lung tumors. Accordingly, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment was highly efficient in mice harboring A20-deficient lung tumors. Furthermore, an A20 loss-of-function gene expression signature positively correlated with survival of melanoma patients treated with anti-programmed cell death protein 1. Together, we have identified A20 as a master immune checkpoint regulating the TBK1-STAT1-PD-L1 axis that may be exploited to improve ICB therapy in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.

BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc505|t|MicroRNA-433 inhibits oral squamous cell carcinoma cells by targeting FAK.
BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc505|a|We investigated the involvement of microRNA-433 (miR-433) in the proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Totally 108 OSCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues from patients with OSCC were collected. Also, transplanted tumor formation experiment in nude mice was conducted to verify the effect of miR-433 and FAK on subcutaneous transplanted tumor. The CD44+ stem cell from SCC-9 were collected and assigned into the blank, miR-433 mimics, mimics control, miR-433 inhibitors, inhibitors control, siFAK and miR-433 inhibitors + siFAK groups. The qRT-PCR and western blotting were used to detect miR-433, FAK, ERK, MEK, pERK and pMEK after transfection. Flow cytometry, MTT assay, scratch test and Transwell assay were performed to determine the cell proportion, growth, migration and invasion of SCC-9 cells. In cell line SCC-9, expression of CD133, Oct-4, and BIM-1 was greater in CD44+ cells than CD44- cells, indicating that CD44+ cells had characteristics of tumor stem cells. Expression of FAK, ERK, MEK, p-ERK and p-MEK was decreased in tumor tissues from the CD44-, miR-433, and siFAK groups. Expression of MiR-433 mRNA was elevated, while levels of FAK, ERK, MEK, p-ERK, and p-MEK mRNA were all decreased in the miR-433 mimics group. In the miR-433 mimics and siFAK groups, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were all decreased, while the opposite trends were seen in the miR-433 inhibitor group. These results indicate that miR-433 downregulates FAK through the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway to inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of SCC-9 OSCC cells.

BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc506|t|ASB13 inhibits breast cancer metastasis through promoting SNAI2 degradation and relieving its transcriptional repression of YAP.
BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc506|a|Transcription factor SNAI2 plays key roles during development and has also been known to promote metastasis by inducing invasive phenotype and tumor-initiating activity of cancer cells. However, the post-translational regulation of SNAI2 is less well studied. We performed a dual-luciferase-based, genome-wide E3 ligase siRNA library screen and identified ASB13 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets SNAI2 for ubiquitination and degradation. ASB13 knockout in breast cancer cells promoted cell migration and decreased F-actin polymerization, while overexpression of ASB13 suppressed lung metastasis. Furthermore, ASB13 knockout decreased YAP expression, and such regulation is dependent on an increased protein level of SNAI2, which in turn represses YAP transcription. YAP suppresses tumor progression in breast cancer, as YAP knockout increases tumorsphere formation, anchorage-independent colony formation, cell migration in vitro, and lung metastasis in vivo. Clinical data analysis reveals that ASB13 expression is positively correlated with improved overall survival in breast cancer patients. These findings establish ASB13 as a suppressor of breast cancer metastasis by promoting degradation of SNAI2 and relieving its transcriptional repression of YAP.

BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc507|t|Sufentanil vs. Dexmedetomidine as Neuraxial Adjuvants in Cesarean Section: A Mono-Centric Retrospective Comparative Study.
BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc507|a|Spinal anesthesia is the best choice for caesarean delivery. This technique is characterized by a complete and predictable nerve block with a fast onset and few complications. Several intrathecal adjuvants are used in order to improve the quality and duration of anesthesia and reduce its side effects. Sixty-two patients who underwent caesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia were included in this medical records review. In this retrospective study, after adopting exclusion criteria, we assessed 24 patients who received Hyperbaric Bupivacaine 0.5% 10 mg and dexmedetomidine 10 mug (G1), and 28 patients who received an institutional standard treatment with Hyperbaric Bupivacaine 0.5% 10 mg and sufentanil 5 mug (G2). We evaluated the difference in terms of motor and sensory block, postoperative pain, and adverse effects during the first 24 h following delivery and neonatal outcome. Our study found that the sufentanil group had a significantly lower requirement for analgesia than the dexmedetomidine group. Postoperative pain, assessed with the VAS scale, was stronger in G1 than in G2 (4 +- 2 vs. 2 +- 1, p-value < 0.01). Differences between the two groups regarding the intraoperative degree of motor and sensory block, motor recovery time, and neonatal Apgar scores were not noticed. Pruritus and shivering were observed only in G2. Itching and shivering did not occur in the dexmedetomidine group. Postoperative analgesia was superior in the sufentanil group, but the incidence of side effects was higher. Adjuvant dexmedetomidine prevented postoperative shivering.

BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc508|t|In search of immune cellular sources of abnormal cytokines in the blood in autism spectrum disorder: A systematic review of case-control studies.
BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc508|a|Abnormal cytokine levels in circulating blood have been repeatedly reported in autism; however, the underlying cause remains unclear. This systematic review aimed to investigate cytokine levels in peripheral blood compartments and identify their potential immune cellular sources in subjects with autism through comparison with controls. We conducted an electronic database search (PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest Central, Ovid, SAGE Journals, and Wiley Online Library) from inception (no time limits) to July 9, 2020, and identified 75 relevant articles. Our qualitative data synthesis focused on results consistently described in at least three independent studies, and we reported the results according to the PRISMA protocol. We found that compared with controls, in subjects with autism, cytokines IL-6, IL-17, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta increased in the plasma and serum. We also identified monocytes, neutrophils, and CD4+ T cells as potential sources of these elevated cytokines in autism. Cytokines IFN-gamma, TGF-beta, RANTES, and IL-8 were increased in the plasma/serum of subjects with autism, and IFN-gamma was likely produced by CD4+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, although conflicting evidence is present for IFN-gamma and TGF-beta. Other cytokines-IL-13, IL-10, IL-5, and IL-4-were found to be unaltered in the plasma/serum and post-stimulated blood immune cells in autistic individuals as compared with controls. The frequencies of T cells, monocytes, B cells, and NK cells were unchanged in subjects with autism as opposed to controls, suggesting that abnormal cytokines were unlikely due to altered cell numbers but might be due to altered functioning of these cells in autism. Our results support existing studies of abnormal cytokines in autism and provide comprehensive evidence of potential cellular sources of these altered cytokines in the context of autism.

BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc509|t|Comprehensive Lipidome Profiling of the Kidney in Early-Stage Diabetic Nephropathy.
BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc509|a|Metabolic changes associated with diabetes are reported to lead to the onset of early-stage diabetic nephropathy (DN). Furthermore, lipotoxicity is implicated in renal dysfunction. Most studies of DN have focused on a single or limited number of lipids, and the lipidome of the kidney during early-stage DN remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we aimed to comprehensively identify lipid abnormalities during early-stage DN; to this end, we established an early-stage DN rat model by feeding a high-sucrose and high-fat diet combined with administration of low-dose streptozotocin. Using a high-coverage, targeted lipidomic approach, we established the lipid profile, comprising 437 lipid species and 25 lipid classes, of the kidney cortex in normal rats and the DN rat model. Our findings additionally confirmed that the DN rat model had been successfully established. We observed distinct lipidomic signatures in the DN kidney, with characteristic alterations in side chain composition and degree of unsaturation. Glyceride lipids, especially cholesteryl esters, showed a significant increase in the DN kidney cortex. The levels of most phospholipids exhibited a decline, except those of phospholipids with side chain of 36:1. Furthermore, the levels of lyso-phospholipids and sphingolipids, including ceramide and its derivatives, were dramatically elevated in the present DN rat model. Our findings, which provide a comprehensive lipidome of the kidney cortex in rats with DN, are expected to be useful for the identification of pathologically relevant lipid species in DN. Furthermore, the results represent novel insights into the mechanistic basis of DN.

BC8_BioRED_Task2_Doc510|t|Transgelin increases metastatic potential of colorectal cancer cells in vivo and alters expression of genes involved in cell motility.
BC8_BioRED_Task2_Doc510|a|BACKGROUND: Transgelin is an actin-binding protein that promotes motility in normal cells. Although the role of transgelin in cancer is controversial, a number of studies have shown that elevated levels correlate with aggressive tumor behavior, advanced stage, and poor prognosis. Here we sought to determine the role of transgelin more directly by determining whether experimental manipulation of transgelin levels in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells led to changes in metastatic potential in vivo. METHODS: Isogenic CRC cell lines that differ in transgelin expression were characterized using in vitro assays of growth and invasiveness and a mouse tail vein assay of experimental metastasis. Downstream effects of transgelin overexpression were investigated by gene expression profiling and quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Stable overexpression of transgelin in RKO cells, which have low endogenous levels, led to increased invasiveness, growth at low density, and growth in soft agar. Overexpression also led to an increase in the number and size of lung metastases in the mouse tail vein injection model. Similarly, attenuation of transgelin expression in HCT116 cells, which have high endogenous levels, decreased metastases in the same model. Investigation of mRNA expression patterns showed that transgelin overexpression altered the levels of approximately 250 other transcripts, with over-representation of genes that affect function of actin or other cytoskeletal proteins. Changes included increases in HOOK1, SDCCAG8, ENAH/Mena, and TNS1 and decreases in EMB, BCL11B, and PTPRD. CONCLUSIONS: Increases or decreases in transgelin levels have reciprocal effects on tumor cell behavior, with higher expression promoting metastasis. Chronic overexpression influences steady-state levels of mRNAs for metastasis-related genes.

BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc511|t|Effects of Protein-Chelated Zinc Combined with Mannan-Rich Fraction to Replace High-Dose Zinc Oxide on Growth Performance, Nutrient Digestibility, and Intestinal Health in Weaned Piglets.
BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc511|a|A total of 168 weaned piglets (average initial body weight of 7.70 +- 0.75 kg) were used in a 4-week feeding trial to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with protein-chelated zinc (Zn-Pro) alone or combined with a mannan-rich fraction (MRF) to replace high-dose zinc oxide (ZnO) for weaned piglets. The dietary treatments included a basal diet as control (CON), a ZnO diet (basal diet + 1600 mg Zn/kg from ZnO), a Zn-Pro diet (basal diet + 60 mg Zn/kg from Zn-Pro), and a MRF plus Zn-Pro diet (MRP, basal diet + 800 mg/kg MRF + 60 mg Zn/kg from Zn-Pro). The average daily gain of piglets in the MRP group was higher (p <= 0.05) than that in CON and Zn-Pro groups during d 15-28 and d 1-28 of experiment. The apparent total tract digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, and crude protein in the MRP group was higher (p <= 0.05) than that in the CON group. The serum insulin-like growth factor-1 level in the MRP group was markedly higher (p <= 0.05) than that of piglets in the other three treatment groups. Piglets fed the Zn-Pro and ZnO diets had greater (p <= 0.05) acetic acid in cecal digesta than those fed the CON diet, while the MRP diet had higher (p <= 0.05) cecal propionate concentration than those that were fed the CON diet on d 28 of experiment. Moreover, the villus height of ileum in the MRP group tended to be greater than the CON group (p = 0.09). Compared with the CON and MRP groups, the relative abundance of Lactobacillaceae (p = 0.08) and Lachnospiraceae (p = 0.09) in the Zn-Pro group showed an increasing trend. The relative abundance of Prevotellaceae in the Zn-Pro group was significantly lower (p <= 0.05) than that in the MRP group. In conclusion, the combined addition of MRF and Zn-Pro acted as a suitable alternative to ZnO to beneficially support the growth performance and intestinal health of weaned piglets, as well as contribute to a lower diarrhea rate and environmental pollution from fecal zinc excretion.

BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc512|t|Early life stressful experiences escalate aggressive behavior in adulthood via changes in transthyretin expression and function.
BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc512|a|Escalated and inappropriate levels of aggressive behavior referred to as pathological in psychiatry can lead to violent outcomes with detrimental impact on health and society. Early life stressful experiences might increase the risk of developing pathological aggressive behavior in adulthood, though molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we provide prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus specific transcriptome profiles of peripubertal stress (PPS) exposed Balb/c adult male mice exhibiting escalated aggression and adult female mice resilient to such aberrant behavioral responses. We identify transthyretin (TTR), a well known thyroid hormone transporter, as a key regulator of PPS induced escalated aggressive behavior in males. Brain region specific long-term changes in Ttr gene expression and thyroid hormone (TH) availability were evident in PPS induced escalated aggressive male mice, circulating TH being unaltered. Ttr promoter methylation marks were also altered being hypermethylated in hypothalamus and hypomethylated in prefrontal cortex corroborating with its expression pattern. Further, Ttr knockdown in hypothalamus resulted in escalated aggressive behavior in males without PPS and also reduced TH levels and expression of TH responsive genes (Nrgn, Trh and Hr). Escalated aggressive behavior along with reduced Ttr gene expression and TH levels in hypothalamus was also evident in next generation F1 male progenies. Our findings reveal that stressful experiences during puberty might trigger lasting escalated aggression by modulating TTR expression in brain. TTR can serve as a potential target in reversal of escalated aggression and related psychopathologies.

BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc513|t|Tumor factors stimulate lysosomal degradation of tumor antigens and undermine their cross-presentation in lung cancer.
BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc513|a|Activities of dendritic cells (DCs) that present tumor antigens are often suppressed in tumors. Here we report that this suppression is induced by tumor microenvironment-derived factors, which activate the activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3) transcription factor and downregulate cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H). Loss of CH25H in antigen presenting cells isolated from human lung tumors is associated with tumor growth and lung cancer progression. Accordingly, mice lacking CH25H in DCs exhibit an accelerated tumor growth, decreased infiltration and impaired activation of intratumoral CD8+ T cells. These mice do not establish measurable long-term immunity against malignant cells that undergo chemotherapy-induced immunogenic cell death. Mechanistically, downregulation of CH25H stimulates membrane fusion between endo-phagosomes and lysosomes, accelerates lysosomal degradation and restricts cross-presentation of tumor antigens in the intratumoral DCs. Administration of STING agonist MSA-2 reduces the lysosomal activity in DCs, restores antigen cross presentation, and increases therapeutic efficacy of PD-1 blockade against tumour challenge in a CH25H-dependent manner. These studies highlight the importance of downregulation of CH25H in DCs for tumor immune evasion and resistance to therapy.

BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc514|t|Central Interaction Between L-Ornithine and Neuropeptide Y in the Regulation of Feeding Behavior of Neonatal Chicks.
BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc514|a|Ornithine has been identified as a potential satiety signal in the brains of neonatal chicks. We hypothesized that brain nutrient signals such as amino acids and appetite-related neuropeptides synergistically regulate food intake. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the interaction between neuropeptide Y (NPY) and ornithine in the control of feeding behavior in chicks and the associated central and peripheral amino acid metabolic processes. Five-day-old chicks were intracerebroventricularly injected with saline, NPY (375 pmol), or NPY plus ornithine (2 or 4 mumol) at 10 mul per chick, and then subjected to ad libitum feeding conditions; food intake was monitored for 30 min after injection. Brain and plasma samples were collected after the experiment to determine free amino acid concentrations. Co-injection of NPY and ornithine significantly attenuated the orexigenic effect induced by NPY in a dose-dependent manner. Central NPY significantly decreased amino adipic acid, asparagine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and isoleucine levels, but significantly increased lysine levels in the brain. Co-injection of NPY and ornithine significantly increased ornithine and proline levels in all examined brain regions, but decreased diencephalic tryptophan and glycine levels compared with those of the control and NPY-alone groups. Co-injection of NPY and high-dose ornithine significantly decreased methionine levels in all brain regions. Central NPY significantly suppressed the plasma concentrations of amino acids, including proline, asparagine, methionine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, isoleucine, glycine, glutamine, alanine, arginine, and valine, and this reduction was greater when NPY was co-injected with ornithine. These results suggest that brain ornithine interacts with NPY to regulate food intake in neonatal chicks. Furthermore, central NPY may induce an anabolic effect that is modified by co-injection with ornithine.

BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc515|t|Modulation of Neutrophil Activity by Soluble Complement Cleavage Products-An In-Depth Analysis.
BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc515|a|The cellular and fluid phase-innate immune responses of many diseases predominantly involve activated neutrophil granulocytes and complement factors. However, a comparative systematic analysis of the early impact of key soluble complement cleavage products, including anaphylatoxins, on neutrophil granulocyte function is lacking. Neutrophil activity was monitored by flow cytometry regarding cellular (electro-)physiology, cellular activity, and changes in the surface expression of activation markers. The study revealed no major effects induced by C3a or C4a on neutrophil functions. By contrast, exposure to C5a or C5a des-Arg stimulated neutrophil activity as reflected in changes in membrane potential, intracellular pH, glucose uptake, and cellular size. Similarly, C5a and C5a des-Arg but no other monitored complement cleavage product enhanced phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species generation. C5a and C5a des-Arg also altered the neutrophil surface expression of several complement receptors and neutrophil activation markers, including C5aR1, CD62L, CD10, and CD11b, among others. In addition, a detailed characterization of the C5a-induced effects was performed with a time resolution of seconds. The multiparametric response of neutrophils was further analyzed by a principal component analysis, revealing CD11b, CD10, and CD16 to be key surrogates of the C5a-induced effects. Overall, we provide a comprehensive insight into the very early interactions of neutrophil granulocytes with activated complement split products and the resulting neutrophil activity. The results provide a basis for a better and, importantly, time-resolved and multiparametric understanding of neutrophil-related (patho-)physiologies.

BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc516|t|A C-X-C Chemokine Receptor Type 2-Dominated Cross-talk between Tumor Cells and Macrophages Drives Gastric Cancer Metastasis.
BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc516|a|PURPOSE: C-X-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CXCR2) is a key regulator that drives immune suppression and inflammation in tumor microenvironment. CXCR2-targeted therapy has shown promising results in several solid tumors. However, the underlying mechanism of CXCR2-mediated cross-talk between gastric cancer cells and macrophages still remains unclear.Experimental Design: The expression of CXCR2 and its ligands in 155 human gastric cancer tissues was analyzed via immunohistochemistry, and the correlations with clinical characteristics were evaluated. A coculture system was established, and functional assays, including ELISA, transwell, cell viability assay, and qPCR, were performed to determine the role of the CXCR2 signaling axis in promoting gastric cancer growth and metastasis. A xenograft gastric cancer model and a lymph node metastasis model were established to study the function of CXCR2 in vivo. RESULTS: CXCR2 expression is associated with the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer (P = 0.002). Of all the CXCR2 ligands, CXCL1 and CXCL5 can significantly promote migration of gastric cancer cells. Macrophages are the major sources of CXCL1 and CXCL5 in the gastric cancer microenvironment, and promote migration of gastric cancer cells through activating a CXCR2/STAT3 feed-forward loop. Gastric cancer cells secrete TNF-alpha to induce release of CXCL1 and CXCL5 from macrophages. Inhibiting CXCR2 pathway of gastric cancer cells can suppress migration and metastasis of gastric cancer in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested a previously uncharacterized mechanism through which gastric cancer cells interact with macrophages to promote tumor growth and metastasis, suggesting that CXCR2 may serve as a promising therapeutic target to treat gastric cancer.

BC8_BioRED_Task1_Doc517|a|Hemin, an oxidized form of heme, acts as potent oxidant to regulate glutathione (GSH) content in pro-erythroid K562 nucleated cells, via activation of the KEAP1/NRF2 defensive signaling pathway. Moreover, GSH, as an essential metabolite, is involved in the regulation of cell-redox homeostasis and proposed to scavenge cytotoxic free heme, which is released from hemoglobin of damaged red blood cells (RBCs) during different hemolytic disorders. In the present study, we aimed to uncover the molecular mechanism by which GSH inhibits hemin-induced cytotoxicity (HIC) by affecting hemin's structural integrity in K562 cells and in RBC hemolysates. GSH, along with other thiols (cysteine, thioglycolic acid, and mercaptoethanol) altered the spectrum of hemin, while each of them co-added with hemin in cultures of K562 cells prevented HIC and growth arrest and markedly reduced the intracellular level of hemin. In addition, GSH endogenous levels served as a barrier to HIC in K562 cells, as shown by the depletion in GSH. LC-MS/MS analysis of the in vitro reaction between hemin and GSH revealed at least five different isomers of GSH-hemin adducts, as well as hydroxy derivatives as reaction products, which are characterized by unique mass spectra (MS). The latter allowed the detection of adducts in human RBC hemolysates. Based on these findings, we proposed a molecular mechanism via which GSH prevents HIC and structurally disintegrates heme. An analogous reaction was observed in RBC hemolysates via direct inter-reaction between hematin (ferric and hydroxide heme) released from hemoglobin and GSH. Overall, GSH-hematin adducts could be considered as novel entities of the human metabolome of RBCs in hemolytic disorders.
